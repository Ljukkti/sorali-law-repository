This law has been accepted by the Yvalnos - Imperial Regent and signed into law.\nSummary This bill defines the place and purpose of the Senate with Soralae.\nArticle 1 focuses on it’s place in government; that it’s bellow the divine council and the triarchs, above the ministries, and that it’s responsible for internal affairs.\nArticle 2 defines that bills can affect both citizens and the ministries, and how ministry-related bills affect them.\nArticle 3 defines how the divine council, the imperial regent, and the triarchs can change the Senate.\nAnd article 4 gives a slight amendment/clarification of how bills can be written, though doesn’t change how the “Etiquette for Bills and Voting in the Senate” works.\nVotes Out of the 10 senators:\n8 voted for 0 against 2 abstained Bill text With the Senate now having systems for voting and bills, it is time to put them to use in defining the powers of the Senate. In order to best represent the voices of the people of Soralae, the Senate agrees to the articles that follow within this document. And by voting on this bill, The First Senate and future Senates agree to use these powers for the betterment and prosperity of Soralae and her people.\nArticle 1: Purpose of the Senate The Senate derives sovereign authority from the Empire of Soralae, its triarchs, and its divine council. The Senate is to govern the internal affairs of the Empire of Soralae and only its internal affairs. This includes all internal institutions such as the ministries unless otherwise stated. External affairs remain to the discretion of the divine council. The Senate, while retaining its autonomy, is still subject to the authority of the divine council and the triarchs. The responsibility of the senate is to preserve the realm of Soralae and lead it to prosperity. Article 2: Jurisdiction of the Senate The Senate has the authority to establish laws for the citizens of Soralae. These laws only affect citizens and travelers. Citizens who are traveling outside the borders of Soralae are still affected by laws when appropriate. Senators are still citizens. The Senate has the authority over the ministries to guide them in their work. The Senate can propose, vote on, and pass acts which dictate the actions of the specific ministry (This includes projects for the ministries). With the approval of the divine council or any of the triarchs, the Senate can establish and dissolve ministries based upon the needs of the empire. This excludes the ministries of architecture, culture, and defense. If a seat of a ministry is vacant, the Senate is allowed to vote upon a new minister, and send this recommendation to the divine council and the triarchs for approval. While the Senate has authority over the ministries, the Senate agrees to respect the autonomy of the ministries. The ministries are allowed to act without prior approval of the senate. Article 3: Supplementary Rules In unprecedented times for the Empire of Soralae, one of the triarch’s or the Imperial Regent has the authority to dismiss the Senate. When this happens, the Senate must be reinstated within one term’s worth of time. If the Senate had not served at least half a term when dismissed, senators can choose to finish out their term after being reinstated. If they choose not to, an election will be held for their seat for the rest of the term. If the Senate has served at least half a term, then elections will happen for a new full term. The jurisdictions of the Senate can be changed directly by either the Imperial Regent or one of the triarchs. There must be a week’s notice before this happens. The Senate or the Imperial Regent may call the Senate into recess. New laws cannot be proposed within this period, but laws proposed before recess is called can still be voted upon. Bills can still be written during this time period, but their authors cannot ping the senator for opinions. The Senate can only call 10 days of recess per term. Recess does not extend terms. Article 4: Bill Writing Bills can be written in either an out of character tone or an in character tone. Bills can be written to have visible effects, such as a law, or be written to only affect Soralae in lore, like a writing project to expand the lore of Soralae. ",
