For the first time the voices of the people can be truly heard: the people now have a say in how they are governed.\nThis Senate, the First Senate of Soralae, intends to make sure that both itself as well as future senates intend to hold itself accountable to the people of Soralae and their imperial majesties in order to make sure this new-found liberty does not find itself muffled or outright silenced. That good manners are kept, barbarism is avoided and that the best interests of the people and the monarchy are kept in mind. This is what This Senate finds to be its utmost priority.\nThis bill before you is the first of many with the intention of guiding how the newly formed senate shall function. It establishes the method of which the voice of the people is first put onto paper and then into law. With it, This Senate places its cornerstone with hopes to project the voice of the people loud and clear.\nArticle 1: The Senate Category on Discord For the purposes of bills in the senate, there will be three channels within the discord: One channel will be dedicated to voting on bills. One channel will be dedicated to proposing, drafting, and discussing bills. This will be a forum and is already created. One channel will be dedicated to storing bills which have passed, and will be open to all citizens. Other channels which are part of the senate category but not necessarily for bills are: The announcement channel, for the imperial regent and divine council to make announcements. Senate-General, for discussions among senators and ministers. The senate category is not limited to the channels mentioned here, as more can be created in time. These are just the minimum channels. Article 2: Voting The format for putting a bill into the voting channel is as followed: Name of bill. Short description of what it plans to do. Link to google doc. Poll for voting. Each bill has a period of three days to be voted on. Each poll will consist of three options: Aye Nay Abstain In order to pass, a bill requires unless said otherwise by the imperial regent or any of the triarchs at least two votes and a majority of the votes being in favor. If the requirements are met then the bill passes. The imperial regent or any of the triarchs can impose a different amount of votes required in order to pass on specific bills. They can also instantly pass a bill. Only senators can vote for bills in the senate. The divine council and any of the triarchs reserve the right to veto any bills, passed or still in vote regardless of reason. That being said, it should, but doesn’t have to, be for a good reason, i.e. out of the senate’s power or passing it would threaten the security of the realm. Article 3: Bills and formatting Bills should be formatted as the following within a Google document: Name of the bill. Name(s) of the person(s) who worked on the bill. Preamble (optional). The action of the bill. It can be written as a paragraph or in a list. Bills can be written in conlang, but must include a legible English copy alongside the conlang copy of the bill; on a separate page or a separate tab. It will be the English copy that is voted on. Anything written in the conlang copy that is not in the English copy will not count as part of the bill. Bills can be proposed that affect stuff either in-game/on discord or in-lore. That means that bills can exist solely for worldbuilding purposes. This, as well as other things bills can and cannot do, will be expanded upon in a later bill. AI can be used in order to assist in writing a bill, but it must be actually written by a person. What an AI can assist in is: Brainstorming. Wording something in a comprehensible manner. Translating for people who don’t speak English as their first language (should include the untranslated copy as well). Writing the description for the vote. Writing a preamble. What AI cannot assist in is: Writing the bill itself. Bills that are found to be written by AI are automatically disqualified from being voted upon until rewritten and the senator(s) who proposed the bill may face repercussions if it’s a repeated offense. Bills that are suspected of being AI must pass AI checkers or have an edit history shown. Bills are not considered to be written by AI during this and can still be voted upon. Such repercussions may include, but are not limited to: Suspension from proposing bills. Suspension from the senate. Repeatedly calling bills “written by AI” in an attempt to silence other senators may result in: Suspension from the senate. Expulsion from the senate. Being banned from running for the senate in the future. Exact repercussions are up to the digression of the Imperial Regent or any of the triarchs. ",

<p>Bill concerning the inner workings of the Senate
In a short summary, it deals with some of the inner workings of the Senate regarding voting procedures.</p>
<hr>
<!-- #### Summary
This bill defines the place and purpose of the Senate with Soralae.
Article 1 focuses on it's place in government; that it's bellow the divine council and the triarchs, above the ministries, and that it's responsible for internal affairs.
Article 2 defines that bills can affect both citizens and the ministries, and how ministry-related bills affect them.
Article 3 defines how the divine council, the imperial regent, and the triarchs can change the Senate.
And article 4 gives a slight amendment/clarification of how bills can be written, though doesn't change how the "Etiquette for Bills and Voting in the Senate" works. -->
<h4 id="votes">Votes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#votes">#</a></h4>

<ul>
